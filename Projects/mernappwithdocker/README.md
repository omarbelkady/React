### Docker Compose
- I will need to run 5 commands to get my app running
- Thanks to Docker compose it will create the configuration file and handle all the necessary commands
- Each container is designed to run a single process

### Dependencies I used
- Express: server framework middleware
- Body Parser: responsible for getting the body of network requests
- Nodemon: Restarts the server automatically when any changes are made
- Cors: Package for using the connect/express middleware that can enable cors with various options
- Mongoose: MongoDB Driver for NodeJS
